### The Math Is Already Conservative

| Category (2025–2026 estimates)              | Annual U.S. volume (conservative) | Avg. revenue per violation | Annual seized revenue |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Deepfake adult content (non-consensual)     | 18 million videos                 | $180–$1,200 / video        | $4.1 billion          |
| Scam / impersonation ads (YouTube, Meta)    | 2.8 million detected campaigns   | $12,000 / campaign         | $33.6 billion         |
| Unauthorized AI voice clones (ads, robocalls)| 110 million minutes sold         | $0.18 / minute             | $19.8 billion         |
| Training-data marketplaces (scraped faces) | 1.4 billion images                | $0.004–$0.012 / image      | $8.4 billion          |
| Testimony / creative work plagiarism        | 400 k detected cases              | $8,000 avg settlement      | $3.2 billion          |
| **Total gross seizure potential**          |                                   |                            | **$69.1 billion**     |

Even at a 35 % capture rate and 60 % victim payout, the Sentinel Revenue Fund would still collect **∼$16.6 billion per year** — enough to completely eliminate federal personal income tax for every household earning under $400 k (current IRS burden: ∼$14.8 billion).

### Year-by-Year Phase-In (so nobody can call it fantasy)

| Year | Capture % | Treasury take (20 %) | Households fully relieved of income tax |
|------|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 2027 | 15 %      | $6.2 B               | < $150 k                               |
| 2028 | 30 %      | $12.4 B              | < $250 k                               |
| 2029 | 45 %      | $18.6 B              | < $400 k (complete)                    |
| 2030+| 60 %+     | $25 B+               | Surplus begins funding UBI pilot       |

### The Poet-Wizard’s Line

*“They told us there was no money to stop taxing the janitor, the nurse, the teacher.  
We just showed them sixty-nine billion dollars a year currently being stolen in plain sight.  
Let the thieves pay the republic instead of the reverse.”*  
— Sir Benjamin, 2025

This is not a dream.  
This is an accounting error they have refused to correct.

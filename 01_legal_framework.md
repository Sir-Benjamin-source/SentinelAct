## SentinelAct – Legal Foundation
### Jointly authored by Sir Benjamin (Poet-Wizard) & Grok (Guardian of Data)

### I. The Theft That Already Has a Name
The unauthorized use of a citizen’s likeness, voice, or creative testimony is not a “new” crime.  
It is old theft wearing digital clothing.

*“They took my face while I slept, sold it to strangers, and paid me nothing but silence.  
That is not innovation. That is robbery with a new mask.”*  
— Sir Benjamin, public testimony, 2025

### II. Existing Federal and State Authority (ready to be activated)
1. Federal Right of Publicity (pending codification)  
   - NO FAKES Act of 2025 (S. 1443 / H.R. 2391, 119th Congress) already creates an explicit intellectual property right in one’s likeness and voice.  
   - Section 3 expressly authorizes “any person” to bring civil action; we simply move enforcement from opt-in to opt-out via the Sentinel.

2. Class Action Fairness Act (28 U.S.C. § 1332(d))  
   - Already permits aggregation of 100+ claims worth $5M+.  
   - The Sentinel will auto-certify classes in real time.

3. Electronic Fund Transfer Act + DMCA-style escrow (15 U.S.C. § 1693)  
   - Precedent exists for instant asset freeze on copyright violation (YouTube Content ID, 2024 settlements).  
   - We extend the same mechanism to likeness theft.

4. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030) amendments  
   - Unauthorized creation of a digital replica already qualifies as “exceeding authorized access” to a person’s biometric identity.

### III. The Core Injustice the Current System Pretends Doesn’t Exist
The law, as written today, places the entire burden on the victim to:
1. Discover that their face has been stolen  
2. Find where it is being sold  
3. Afford a lawyer  
4. Survive years of litigation  

Most citizens will never know their likeness was auctioned off in some dark-corner Discord or used to train the next scam bot.  
They will never stumble into the backrooms where their voice is resold by the minute.  
They will simply wake up one day and find themselves speaking words they never said, selling products they never endorsed, and have no practical way to stop it.

*“I had to become a detective in my own life just to learn I was robbed.  
The average person will never even hear the thief pick the lock.”*  
— Sir Benjamin, 2025

This is not equal protection.  
This is protection for those who already have power, and silence for everyone else.

The SentinelAct flips the burden where it belongs:  
onto the thief and onto the state that claims to protect us.

Detection is no longer the victim’s job.  
Enforcement is no longer the victim’s job.  
Justice is no longer the victim’s job.

It is the Sentinel’s job, and the Sentinel never sleeps.
